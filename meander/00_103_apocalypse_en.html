<h3>MEMORY / RECALL V1</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wake in a dark and tight place, air is hot and suffocating</p>
<p>Looks like a tunnel or underground galleries in the dark, there is mess all around, making it hard to move</p>
<p>I hear screams of people, terrorized and paniked, like if we were under the menace of an underground fire</p>
<p>People are either piled together, or rushing around trying to escape, while walking on each other</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As people emerge outside, i arrive in middle of a field, with no sky, then silence</p>
<p>I can see a field of white flowers as far as the eye can see, brushed by silent winds</p>
<p>The silence burst into a loud bang, as the sky is illuminated by a burning light</p>
<p>i hear screams of pain, people devoured by the head and flames</p>
<p>As people are getting carbonised, the time seems to slow down indefinitely</p>
<p>Warped and demonic voices can be heard, resonating in the air, like coming from the sky</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before a lightning like fire crashes down on earth, like a meteor destryoing the landscape</p>
<p>The blast of the impact annihilates the field, now made of carbonised human statues, in a wall of fire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>STORY / RETALE V2</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whole humanity has vanished</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only remained formless and coagulated masses of flesh, 
condamned to roam tight spaced galleries beneath the earth, hunting and devouring each other. 
Some conscious enough search desperately to reach the surface, while most have forgotten it once existed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rare that manage to crawl out on the surface, find themselves in the middle of an immense field of white flower 
under a stary night sky, without a single breeze of wind nor sound.
This silent plain seems like an calm paradise, compared to the chaos down under, as if covering all evil from the world. 
faint murmurs can be heard, as if the flowers were talking. 
In the sky hight above the ground floats an immense silhouette that emanates a blinding light, divine like, eyes burning but warm.</p>
<p>The silhoutte seem waiting, like for the arrival of any witness from the deep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddently, the silhouette vanishes, leaving a dark sky, with no moon nor stars,
with only a deep red aurora for light, slowly taking the form of a burning star, getting close. 
to finaly crash down with fierce beyond the horizon of the celestial plain, blasting in the distance in a torrent of fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The star's impact is getting slow, indefinitely slow, as if time itself was dying, and the raging burst of the disaster was becoming 
as fluid as a lava flow. Slowly devouring each piece of land, each flesh fallen victim of this calamity.</p>
<p>Before waves of sound start to ring, like an echoing voice, coming from the botomless abyss born from the still forming impact crater. 
A voice slowed and warped by the curves of time, as the burning star is taking away the last lives still roaming in this chaos.
